this web site make a search for any user in github and returns some details about him
i used ajax , spa ,routes ,rest, servers and node js to build this web site

bugs:
the saved and delete button is not working cause the functions did not works will so i delete the body fuction from the
main javascript file

saved button is working will and returns the data about the user.

Ajax
a.	‏URL:'https://api.github.com/users/' + username
b.	פרמטרים (‏שליחה): name of the user
c.	returns the data we want and saved it 
2. if we get back the data we will use it to fill the output so we validate it each
